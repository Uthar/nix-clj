There's a bug somewhere deeper that adds a naked -I flag to gcc. That causes it
to consider the next flag as an include path. In this case, it was ignoring the
'-c' flag, and so was trying to link what was supposed to be an object
file. This Ãœberhack is to make sure that that trailing naked -I doesn't consume
an important flag. Instead, feed a non-important flag to it.
